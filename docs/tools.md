# BetterOff tools

[All clients](../README.md#install-the-connector) · [Connector reference](connector.md)

Connector package 0.6.0 describes hosted server 0.5.0 at `https://api.betteroff.finance/mcp` and defines 31 tools: 23 read tools and 8 write tools. A client sees only the tools its granted scopes allow.

- **Read** tools return data and change nothing.
- **Write** tools save a pending correction or transfer request, cancel a pending request, or send feedback. None can apply a correction, approve a transfer, or sign a transaction. You do those in BetterOff. Cancellation and feedback take effect when called.
- Every tool requires BetterOff Core, over MCP or REST. The Free plan and trials do not include tool access.

The same catalog is available as [tools.json](../tools.json). With an API token, call any tool at `POST https://api.betteroff.finance/v1/tools/{name}`; see the [developer documentation](https://betteroff.finance/developers) and the [tool OpenAPI document](https://api.betteroff.finance/openapi/tools.json).
